Hi, Budgey
If you're reading this, you managed to successfully figure out how Git works, which is cool because it's one of the most widely used
version control systems in the world. Basically, this "repository" called "li-brothers" acts as an online database for us to store files
in and "push" updates to. What's really great about something like this is that we can maintain the codebase that we eventually build out
very easily and access the history of the entire repository or individual files at any time. I.E: if one of us fucks up, we can just revert
the entire repository back to a previous build. Very safe, very fast, very secure, and free. 

Here's what I recommend you start with:

1. https://csedweek.org/
//This is an hour long introduction called "hour of code"
//As you might have deduced, it takes one hour to complete but does a decent job of introducing programming to noobs

2. https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
//This is a link to download android studio, the development software necessary to start building android applications
//Download this (it'll take a while)

3. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-To-Create-An-Android-App-With-Android-Studio/
//How to build your first Android app
//Follow the steps and try to have fun with this - you can literally do anything
